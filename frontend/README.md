## Overview

The Doctor Appointment Booking Website is a full-stack application that allows patients to schedule appointments with doctors. The website's responsive frontend, built with **React Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**, provides an intuitive interface for patients to find available doctors and book appointments online. This project demonstrates my skills in frontend development, with the backend currently in development.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for both patients and doctors.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Patients can view available doctors, check schedules, and book appointments directly.
- **Doctor Dashboard**: Provides doctors with an interface to manage their schedules and appointments.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop using Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React Vite**: For fast development and optimized builds.
- **JavaScript**: Handles application logic.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for quick and responsive UI styling.
